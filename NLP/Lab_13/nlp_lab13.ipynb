    "# The Annotated Encoder-Decoder with Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Alexander Rush wrote a blog post called [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html), describing the Transformer model from the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). This post can be seen as a **prequel** to that: *we will implement an Encoder-Decoder with Attention* using (Gated) Recurrent Neural Networks, very closely following the original attention-based neural machine translation paper [\"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) of Bahdanau et al. (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that going through both blog posts will make you familiar with two very influential sequence-to-sequence architectures. If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know: [@BastingsJasmijn](https://twitter.com/BastingsJasmijn)."

    "# Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the probability $p(Y\\mid X)$ of a target sequence $Y=(y_1, \\dots, y_{N})$ given a source sequence $X=(x_1, \\dots, x_M)$ directly with a neural network: an Encoder-Decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/bastings/annotated_encoder_decoder/blob/master/images/bahdanau.png?raw=1\" width=\"636\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder reads in the source sentence (*at the bottom of the figure*) and produces a sequence of hidden states $\\mathbf{h}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{h}_M$, one for each source word. These states should capture the meaning of a word in its context of the given sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a bi-directional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN) as the encoder; a Bi-GRU in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we **embed** the source words.\n",
    "We simply look up the **word embedding** for each word in a (randomly initialized) lookup table.\n",
    "We will denote the word embedding for word $i$ in a given sentence with $\\mathbf{x}_i$.\n",
    "By embedding words, our model may exploit the fact that certain words (e.g. *cat* and *dog*) are semantically similar, and can be processed in a similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we get hidden states $\\mathbf{h}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{h}_M$? A forward GRU reads the source sentence left-to-right, while a backward GRU reads it right-to-left.\n",
    "Each of them follows a simple recursive formula:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}_j = \\text{GRU}( \\mathbf{x}_j , \\mathbf{h}_{j - 1} )$$\n",
    "i.e. we obtain the next state from the previous state and the current input word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden state of the forward GRU at time step $j$ will know what words **precede** the word at that time step, but it doesn't know what words will follow. In contrast, the backward GRU will only know what words **follow** the word at time step $j$. By **concatenating** those two hidden states (*shown in blue in the figure*), we get $\\mathbf{h}_j$, which captures word $j$ in its full sentence context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder (*at the top of the figure*) is a GRU with hidden state $\\mathbf{s_i}$. It follows a similar formula to the encoder, but takes one extra input $\\mathbf{c}_{i}$ (*shown in yellow*).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{s}_{i} = f( \\mathbf{s}_{i - 1}, \\mathbf{y}_{i - 1}, \\mathbf{c}_i )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{y}_{i - 1}$ is the previously generated target word (*not shown*).\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, an **attention mechanism** dynamically selects that part of the source sentence that is most relevant for predicting the current target word. It does so by comparing the last decoder state with each source hidden state. The result is a context vector $\\mathbf{c_i}$ (*shown in yellow*).\n",
    "Later the attention mechanism is explained in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing the decoder state $\\mathbf{s}_i$, a non-linear function $g$ (which applies a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)) gives us the probability of the target word $y_i$ for this time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(y_i \\mid y_{<i}, x_1^M) = g(\\mathbf{s}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i, \\mathbf{y}_{i - 1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $g$ applies a softmax, it provides a vector the size of the output vocabulary that sums to 1.0: it is a distribution over all target words. During test time, we would select the word with the highest probability for our translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for optimization, a [cross-entropy loss](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html#cross-entropy) is used to maximize the probability of selecting the correct word at this time step. All parameters (including word embeddings) are then updated to maximize this probability.\n",
